CHANGELOG  28-29 MAR 2004 jeffs
1. JmDNS

  - Added probing thread to handle address record probing and conflicts

  - Fixed wait times to be in line with the draft mDNS spec.

  -  Added query cache so can check if another machine is also 
     probing for our address.

  - Added support for slowing down the request rate during
    probing as per the draft mDNS spec.

  - Added conflict checks.
  
  - General code clean up.

  - changed visibility of static debug variable to public 
  so apps can check it and decide to do their own logging and so on
  
  - changed visbility of all non-static variables to private
  
  - added package protected method getCache() 
  
  - broke up handleQuery() into:

        private DNSOutgoing typeA()
        private DNSOutgoing typePTR()
        private DNSOutgoing findService()
  
  - reduced handleQuery() synchronized block 
  to just cover Socket.send() call

  [need to figure out what else needs synchronization]

2. ServiceInfo

  - changed all calls to JmDNS cache variable 
  to use JmDNS getCache() accessor instead
  
  - replaced javadoc comment 
        <code>_http._tcp.local.</code>
  with 
        <code>_http&#46;_tcp.local&#46;</code>
  so the javadoc tool would quit whining
  
3. DNSConstants

  - Added constants for wait times and probe times.

  - changed to be a final class
  
  - changed all references to it's fields in all other classes
  to read DNSConstants.whatever


Know Problems.

-- The additional section is broken in handleQuery.  This will be fixed in the next go round.

-- Service probing is still not to spec.  No conflict resolution.

-- Still can blow address space on very busy networks.
